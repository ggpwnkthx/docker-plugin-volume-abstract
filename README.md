# docker-plugin-volume-abstract
Simplified starting point for Docker volume driver

Shouldn't need to mess with main.go or interface.go, instead focus on the driver.go file to handle the actual processes and logistics of what the volume driver needs to do.

## One Liner
```git clone https://github.com/ggpwnkthx/docker-plugin-volume-abstract && cd docker-plugin-volume-abstract; chmod +x build.sh; ./build.sh```
